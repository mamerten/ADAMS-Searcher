# Adams Web Searcher

A Cloudflare Pages web app that lets engineers search the NRC ADAMS document database
in plain language. Claude drives the search server-side (on the operator's paid API
tokens), using the real `adams-search-api` skill as its playbook and calling the ADAMS
API directly. Output is a plain-language analysis the user can save as a bookmarked PDF.

## Local development

```
npm install
npm run dev          # serves on http://localhost:8788
```

`npm run dev` automatically re-bundles the skill + reference files first (see below). You need a `.dev.vars` file (git-ignored) with the two secrets:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-…"
ADAMS_API_KEY     = "…"          # ADAMS APS subscription key
```

These are read **server-side only**, in the Pages Functions under `functions/api/`.
They never reach the browser. **Never commit `.dev.vars`.**

## The skill is the source of truth — and now lives in this repo

The app does **not** paraphrase the search methodology in code. The real
`adams-search-api` skill is embedded verbatim as the model's system prompt. It was
originally forked from Mat's Claude Cowork `adams-search-api` skill — the two share a
common ancestor but have since **forked away from each other and now evolve
independently**, which is half the fun: this team app is free to grow in directions the
personal Cowork skill never will, and vice versa. This repo's copy is the source of
truth for the app and is **no longer synced from Cowork**.

You edit the skill as plain Markdown; a small build step bundles it into the JS the app
imports. Both the skill and the references work exactly the same way — in-repo Markdown
source → generated `lib/*.js`:

| Edit this (source) | Run this | Generates (deployed) |
|---|---|---|
| `skill/adams-search-api.md` | `npm run sync-skill` | `lib/skill.js` |
| any `.md` in `references/` | `npm run sync-refs` | `lib/references.js` |

Both sources are **in this repo** — neither reads from Cowork or any external path.
`npm run dev` runs `npm run sync` (both generators) for you via the `predev` hook, so
local dev always reflects your latest edits. You rarely need to run them by hand.

## Shipping a skill change to production

```
# 1. edit skill/adams-search-api.md (plain Markdown)
npm run sync-skill           # regenerate lib/skill.js (or just start the dev server)
git add skill/adams-search-api.md lib/skill.js   # commit BOTH the source and the artifact
git commit -m "Skill: <what changed>"
git push                     # Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys from the connected repo
```

`lib/skill.js` is the committed artifact that actually deploys — Cloudflare's build
servers run no generator, so whatever `lib/skill.js` you push is exactly what ships. If
you edit the `.md` but forget to regenerate, you'll commit a stale `lib/skill.js`;
`npm run dev` regenerates it for you, which is the easy safeguard.

> **Committed, not ignored:** the Markdown sources (`skill/`, `references/`) **and** the
> generated `lib/skill.js` / `lib/references.js` are all intentionally tracked in git.
> The generated files are what deploy — do not add them to `.gitignore`.

## Deployment

Cloudflare Pages, building from the connected GitHub repo:

- **Build output directory:** `public` (see `wrangler.toml`)
- **Functions:** `functions/api/` (server-side; hold the two secrets as encrypted
  Pages Secrets — set them in the Cloudflare dashboard, the production analog of
  `.dev.vars`)
- No build/compile step regenerates the skill — the committed `lib/*.js` deploy as-is.

A manual deploy from your machine is also available: `npm run deploy`.

## Architecture (one paragraph)

Single endpoint `POST /api/agent` runs **one** model turn per call; the browser owns
the loop (each call stays short to dodge Function timeouts). The model gets the skill +
bundled Hatch references as a cached system prompt and two tools — `adams_search` and
`adams_get_document` — executed server-side where the keys live. The skill's human
gates (confirm plan, confirm documents to open) are natural pause points: the model
ends its turn and the browser shows a reply box. The final report renders to a
bookmarked PDF entirely client-side (jsPDF, vendored in `public/vendor/`) — zero model
tokens.
